# Vegarden

### Vegarden is an app for managing your veggie garden

It's written in Swift 3 and is focused to run mainily on iPad devices. It's an ongoing project, that's on hold at the moment.

#### Here's a list of things you can do with Vegarden App:

- Learn about different crops with the **Vegarden** Database
- Follow the life cycle of your planted crops
- Manage your garden by adding or removing patches and rows!
- Add crops to My Crops screen from the Database to have a quick access
- Add Notes from the Life Cycle screen every time you Fertilize, Weed or Water your crops.
- Follow the progress of your crops from the My Garden or LifeCycle screens
- Add, Remove or Edit your veggie patchs from My Garden Screen
- Add, Remove or Edit rows of any patch from My Garden Screen


#### There's still a lot of things to do:

- Refactor and clean up of code (most of the code is quite old and can be done much better)
- It needs an API for the database, currently is running a CoreData database with all the veggies
- Redesign of UI. I did all the UI design (not a designer clearly)
- Lots of bug fixing and improvements.
